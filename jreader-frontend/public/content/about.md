# About JReader

JReader is a new tool inspired by the now-classic setup of ttsu-reader + Yomitan, built to enable reading ePubs on iPhone, iPad, and e-ink tablets.
Of course, desktop browsers are also just as well-supported!
The dictionary also works standalone at [http://jreader.moe/dictionary](http://jreader.moe/dictionary).

I did my best to make sure that the dictionary results shown on this website match what you would get on Yomitan, which is the gold standard.
I know there are still some edge cases, so bug reports are welcome!

## Features

- **Cross-device sync** — Pick up a book on one device and continue it later on from any other
- **Track unknown kanji** — Get a sense of how comprehensible a page of text is at a glance. As you look up words, JReader will automatically track the known/encountered/unknown status of kanji for you. This approach focuses on extensive reading and developing the ability to guess kanji readings correctly, rather than memorizing every single unknown word
- **Access to dozens of Japanese dictionaries** — Including larger ones such as Pixiv and Wikipedia (pretty much any dictionary you would normally add to Yomitan is available here)
- **Pitch accent graphs**
- **Hide any dictionaries with a spoiler** — Useful if you want to check the bilingual definition only after trying to read the monolingual one
- **Full deinflection support via MeCab**
- **Super easy recursive lookups** - Built with the monolingual transition in mind. I have gone through this myself and I believe JReader has the cleanest workflow to faciliate the monolingual transition
- **E-ink mode** — Disable fancy transitions and switch to monochrome to reduce battery usage and improve visibility
- **Narou import** — Import Japanese web novels directly from [Narou](https://syosetu.com) with just a URL. Many popular series have already been imported and are instantly available for reading!
